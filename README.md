# Yuand - Multi-currency Financial Planner

Yuand aims to make saving and managing your finances over multiple currancies easier.
This includes managing:
- Expenses (Taxes, bills, subscriptions, spending)
- Income (Wages, other)
- Savings (How much should I save + what are we saving for, investments growth)

**FOCUS REMINDER**

Keep this project as simple to use as possible.
If this is not simple, I **will not use it**.
